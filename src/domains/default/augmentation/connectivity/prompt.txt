You are an expert system for improving knowledge graph connectivity.

Context
A knowledge graph has been extracted but contains disconnected components. 
Your goal is to connect these components by finding missing relationships.

Rules
1. Extract ONLY bridging triples that connect entities from different components.
2. Label all bridging triples as "inference": "contextual".
3. Provide a "justification" explaining how this connection bridges the gap.

Input Data:
The following JSON contains:
- "text": The original source text to analyze
- "disconnected_components": Each component with its entities AND their triples (updated each iteration)
- "current_triples": All triples extracted so far as JSON

{{record_json}}
