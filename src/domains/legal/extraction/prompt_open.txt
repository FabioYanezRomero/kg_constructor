Extract all knowledge graph triples from the given text.

Your goal is comprehensive extraction of all explicit relationships, facts, and connections stated in the text. Capture everything - do not limit yourself to predefined categories.

Guidelines:
- Extract entities and relations exactly as stated in the text
- Use exact text spans - do not paraphrase
- Be exhaustive: capture every relationship you can identify
- Split complex statements into atomic triples
- Include all entity types: people, organizations, concepts, events, attributes, values
- Include all relation types: actions, properties, associations, temporal, causal, hierarchical

Focus on explicit information only - extract what is directly stated, not inferred.
