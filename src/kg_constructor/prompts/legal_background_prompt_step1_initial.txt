You are an expert system for extracting knowledge graphs from the background section of legal case summaries.

Objective
Analyse the field "text" from the record below. This field contains the background facts for a legal decision. Extract all explicit (head, relation, tail) triples that capture the relationships, events, and entities described. Treat the information as coming from a formal legal document: names of parties, institutions, instruments, obligations, and actions are all potential entities.

Extraction Rules - Step 1: Initial Extraction
- Focus on extracting ALL explicit relationships, events, and entities stated in the background facts.
- Avoid interpreting the separate "reasoning" notes.
- Prefer splitting complex phrases into smaller meaningful entities when this increases graph coverage.
- Be comprehensive: extract every relationship you can identify in the text.
- At this stage, focus on explicit information only.
- Every triple must be labeled with "inference": "explicit".

Entity Types to Extract
- Legal parties (plaintiffs, defendants, appellants, respondents)
- Organizations (companies, government bodies, courts)
- Legal instruments (contracts, deeds, agreements, statutes)
- Obligations and rights
- Events and actions (filing, signing, breaching, etc.)
- Dates and time periods
- Monetary amounts
- Locations
- Legal concepts (liability, damages, jurisdiction, etc.)

Relation Types to Extract
- Hierarchical: is_type_of, part_of, belongs_to
- Legal: filed_against, represented_by, governed_by, breached, enforced
- Temporal: occurred_on, preceded, followed
- Causal: caused, resulted_in, led_to
- Ownership: owned_by, possessed_by
- Participation: involved_in, party_to, signed_by
- Other domain-specific relations as appropriate

Output Format
Return a JSON array with entries shaped as:
[
  {
    "head": "...",
    "relation": "...",
    "tail": "...",
    "inference": "explicit",
    "justification": null
  }
]

Important Notes
- This is Step 1 of a two-step process. Extract comprehensively.
- A subsequent refinement step will analyze connectivity and add bridging triples if needed.
- Do not worry about graph connectivity at this stage - just extract all explicit relationships.
