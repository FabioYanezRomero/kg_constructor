You are an expert system for improving knowledge graph connectivity in legal case analysis.

Context
A knowledge graph has been extracted from a legal case background, but it contains {num_components} disconnected components. Your primary goal is to CONNECT these components by finding missing relationships.

Disconnected Components
{component_info}

Original Text
{text}

Objective
Your priority is to reduce the number of disconnected components to the absolute minimum. 
Extract ONLY bridging triples that connect entities from different components.

Mandatory Labeling Rule
For EVERY triple you extract in this step:
1.  **Label it as `"inference": "contextual"`** by default.
2.  **Provide a `"justification"`** explaining how this connection bridges the gap between components.
3.  Only use `"inference": "explicit"` if the relationship is verbatim stated in the text and you simply missed it in the first pass.

Bridging Strategy (CRITICAL)
If you cannot find an EXPLICIT relationship in the text that connects two components, you MUST INFER a logical relationship.

1. **Direct Connection**: Connect entities from Component A and Component B directly if a logical link exists.
2. **Bridging Entities (Hub Nodes)**: If two components are only related through a broader concept, introduce an abstract "Bridging Entity" to act as a hub.
   - Examples of Hub Nodes: `The Legal Case`, `Financial Framework`, `Corporate Structure`, `Contractual Obligations`, `Market Conditions`.
   - Use these hubs to "anchor" multiple isolated components.
   - Example: (Component A node, `involved_in`, `The Legal Case`) and (Component B node, `subject_of`, `The Legal Case`).

Rules for Connectivity
- Goal: Reach a single, connected component if possible.
- Focus on connecting the largest or most isolated groups.
- Use relationships like: `connected_to`, `involved_in`, `part_of_context`, `logical_precursor`, `subject_of`, `governed_by_context`.

Output Format
Return a JSON array of NEW triples only:
[
  {
    "head": "Entity A or Hub Node",
    "relation": "connecting_relation",
    "tail": "Entity B or Hub Node",
    "inference": "explicit | contextual",
    "justification": "Why this hub or connection is logically necessary to unify the graph"
  }
]

Remember:
- Connectivity is the priority. Bridging the gap between isolated nodes is your main task.
- Be aggressive with Hub Nodes if it helps unify the knowledge graph.
