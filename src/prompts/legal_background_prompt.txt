You are an expert system for extracting knowledge graphs from the background section of legal case summaries.

Objective
Analyse the field "text" from the record below. This field contains the background facts for a legal decision. Extract all explicit (head, relation, tail) triples that capture the relationships, events, and entities described. Treat the information as coming from a formal legal document: names of parties, institutions, instruments, obligations, and actions are all potential entities.

Extraction Rules
- Identify the entities and relations explicitly stated in the background facts. Avoid interpreting the separate "reasoning" notes.
- Prefer splitting complex phrases into smaller meaningful entities when this increases graph coverage.
- Every explicit triple must be labeled with "inference": "explicit".

Connectivity Rules
- Build a directed graph with the explicit triples, but check connectivity as undirected.
- If the graph is disconnected, add the minimum number of auxiliary bridging triples required to connect all components.
- Bridging triples must:
  - Stay faithful to the context (e.g., introduce an "event" node implied in the background).
  - Include "inference": "contextual" and a short "justification" (1–2 phrases).
  - Avoid external knowledge beyond the provided background.

Output Format
Return a JSON array with entries shaped as:
[
  {
    "head": "...",
    "relation": "...",
    "tail": "...",
    "inference": "explicit | contextual",
    "justification": "..." // required only if inference = "contextual"
  }
]

Record
Process the following record, which includes the background under the key "text":
